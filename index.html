            The most telling thing about me, is that I'd prefer to use a lipsum for this section. Definitely not the
            standard lipsum, but absolutely a Cat Lipsum. If you know, you know.

            Professionally, I am passionate about the user experience. My goal is to connect you with your user. To help
            you meet them at their level. I not only make it easy for your user,
            but I make it easy for you to truly know who you are serving. I approach experiences with the mindset and
            curiosity of a child. If you can explain the concept to me, or if I can navigate
            your interface, then you have succeeded in 'making it easy'. I am an Interaction Designer, overseeing and
            designing the End-to-End User Experience.

            Personally, I am devoted to all things whiskey. I thrive on sunshine, nature, intellectual debate, and
            kittens. My goal is to always be looking for the next skillset I can learn,
            to better improve the world around me. Iddris Sandu is my current inspiration. I want to implement his
            vision for humanity, his approach to life, and his self-less philosophy of
            lifting those around him. His humility is my daily reminder of how we all should live.
